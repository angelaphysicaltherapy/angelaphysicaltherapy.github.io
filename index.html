        <h2>About me</h2>
        <article>
            Hi I am Anqi, a Omaha based developer, physcial therapy by training and designer by heart. I consider Omaha my second hometown hence I collected all its secretive spots for cheap bites with excellent taste or coffee spots with right vibes. <break>
            I am originally from Beijing. The ancient city with both the bustling alleys where passengers hustling to the steamy breakfast shops before the start of their days, peddlers selling roasted chestnut along the ginkgo tress when the leaves turned golden in the deep fall and the red brick palace with glamorous golden tiles under white fresh snow, so quite that you could hear the stories that passed through history like a whisper. Thatâ€™s where my journey started where all the dream and hope originated. <br>
            What change my mind to becoming a developer? I worked in San Francisco as a pelvic floor physical therapist for a year. Maybe is the tech atmosphere in the bay that wakes up the creative side of mind or the realization that maybe health education in self care is the ultimate way to deliver scarce health care resources to its unbalance need.
